# Vircon32 Specification

These documents are intended to define what a Vircon32 system is. Together they will constitute an open standard and, as such, they are the most essential part of the Vircon32 project.

Vircon32 is a greatly simplified system (it was one of its main design goals). However the full specification is still long, because it aims to explain all aspects of the console and makes heavy use of images, tables and diagrams.

For that reason, rather than making a single large document, the specification has been split into different documents. Each of them covers different aspects or components of the console.
